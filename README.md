I’m @AlecGrover and I make games!

I’m a Canadian software engineer with an area of concentration in AI and a passion for all things games related
(and a few too many other topics to be reasonable). When I'm not working I can be found teaching new players
Destiny raids, playing D&D (or working on the world I will "someday DM for"), learning obscure trivia, or
inventing cocktails.

I'm an experienced developer in both C# and Unity and more recently with C++ and Unreal.
I also have significant previous experience in Java, Python, and some web development. I recently graduated and
am currently looking to start working as a software engineer for a game studio, and maybe even getting a shot at
my dream of working for Bungie!

If you want to reach out you can get in touch through my [personal website](https://alecgrover.com) or by
shooting me a DM on Twitter [@SlushOnTTV](https://twitter.com/SlushOnTTV). I'd love to hear from you!

Or if you want to play some of the games I'm working on, check me out [itch.io](https://sergeant-slash.itch.io) :D
